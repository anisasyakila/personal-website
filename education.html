<p>
My educational journey began in a small, colorful preschool classroom filled with toys, books, and eager young minds. I went to Sungai Pas Preschool at 5 years old. It was a world of discovery where I learned the basics of social interaction, sharing, and cooperation. The emphasis on play-based learning allowed me to develop crucial cognitive and motor skills. I met new friends at preschool and became close friends throughout the year. I remember the joy of finger painting and sports, the excitement of storytime, and the satisfaction of building tall towers with blocks. These early experiences fostered a love for learning and curiosity that would stay with me throughout my educational journey.</p>

Next, elementary school was a period of significant growth and development. In 2010, I went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Pas which is near my house. Starting as a first-grade student, I learned to read, write, and perform basic arithmetic. Transitioning from play-based learning to a more structured educational environment was challenging but exciting. My teachers played an important role in nurturing my academic interests. Mr.Azmi, my third-grade teacher, always helped me whenever I needed help. He also introduced me to the world of science through hands-on experiments and engaging lessons. I still remember the thrill of watching a seed germinate and grow into a plant. These early academic experiences laid a strong foundation for my future studies. </p>

<p>
High school was the most transformative period of my educational journey. In 2016, after I graduated from elementary school, I went to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Mengkebang at 13 years old until 18 years old. However, high school was a period of transition and self-discovery. It was a time of increased academic rigor, greater responsibility, and preparation for the future. I was exposed and introduced to a broader range of subjects, including advanced mathematics, literature, and sciences. The opportunity to choose elective courses allowed me to delve deeper into my interests. It was a time when I began to explore my interests and develop a sense of identity. The academic workload increased but I particularly enjoyed my geography class, where I acquired the ability to interpret the distribution and processes of physical and human phenomena and locate places and the relationship between them according to scale. High school also provided numerous opportunities for personal growth and leadership. I also joined a co-curricular camp in school, which taught me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and community service. Balancing academics with extracurricular activities was challenging but rewarding. The support and guidance of my teachers, particularly my guidance counselor, were instrumental in helping me navigate the college application process and make informed decisions about my future. This school taught me the importance of perseverance, time management, and the value of extracurricular activities in providing a well-rounded education. However, it was also a time of immense personal growth. The challenges of adolescence, including social pressures and the quest for independence, made this period particularly tumultuous.</p>

<p>
After I finished my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia(SPM) in 2021 and got my result, I furthered my studies at Form 6 with my friends from 2021 until 2023. In form 6, it is a bit challenging for me because the subjects are more difficult than in high school. However, I managed to finish my studies due to the blessings of my teachers and supportive family. </p>

<p>
From the playful preschool environment to the challenging and formative years of high school, my educational journey has been a path of continuous learning and growth. Each stage has contributed to my development, shaping my academic interests, personal values, and career aspirations. The experiences, challenges, and successes I encountered along the way have prepared me for the next chapter of my life. As I look forward to college and beyond, I am grateful for the foundation that my education has provided and excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
